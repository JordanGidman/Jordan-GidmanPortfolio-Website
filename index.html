            This entire portfolio is made from scratch by me, no templates were used and i would consider
            this a project in itself.<br><br>
            <span>HTML</HTML></span> - Confident. Although i am confident in HTML i am
            also aware that i do not know everything and i am excited to use it
            more.
            <br /><br />
            <span>CSS</span> - Confident. I feel i can make almost anything i see with CSS
            but again i know far from everything and i have yet to dive into any
            CSS Frameworks which i cant wait to do. <br />
            <br />
            <span>JavaScript</span> - Almost Confident. I do know the basics of javascript as
            you can see both in this portfolio and on my GitHub and i can build
            apps and functionality from the ground up. And i feel im at a point
            where with the help of Stack Overflow i am capable of using
            JavaScript to solve problems

            Breif summary of my employment history and skills gained from it
          </h4>
          <p class="tab-text">
            For a more detailed and formatted work history please see CV. To sum things up i have had no relevant work experience
            as of yet. I have however had jobs that given me numerous transferrable skills ranging from working with a sales agency
            which gave a lot of insight and training into marketing, sales and E-Commerce. I have also worked in nightclubs and bars
            which was a high speed high pressure environment dealing with intoxicated customers and defusing situations in a busy environment. 
            <br> <br>
            My current job with the NHS has helped me refine my problem solving ability as the nature of my work means i resolve
            issues that arise during the appointment booking process. And although its nothing compared to using code to solving a
            problem, however it does require critical thinking which i find is incredibly useful when coding.

            Some personal details to help you get to know me
          </h4>
          <p class="tab-text">
           My name is Jordan Gidman and im a 25 year old from bolton. About 6 months ago i started my journey of 
            learning to code. As soon as i built my first calculator from scratch i was hooked. The endless possibilty and room for
            learning. Its hard to ever get bored of a job that is constantly evolving and improving as it grows and expands and thats
            how i found my passion for Web Development. Im highly ambitious and motivated to work in this industry and im willing to work 
            to get it.
            
            <br><br>
            I have always loved solving puzzles and problems ever since i was read sherlock holmes as a child and played professor
            layton on the DS when that was all the rage and im happy to have found a career that is not a detective but i still 
            get to solve puzzles and they all have answers. Outside of coding i love to play video games such as Valorant, WoW, and Elden Ring, and ive probably seen any TV show 
            you can think of. I also love to travel and see some of the amazing things our wolrd has to offer.

        the user to add any of the video game keys you see on offer to a cart which tracks the number of
        items that have been added and displays it to screen it will also calculate a total cost for the 
        basket and users can add and remove items and the total will remain up to date. This was my first 
        "real world" application and i learned a lot about the DOM and event bubbling. i have also added
        sorting buttons which can be seen in the second image that are functional and will sort based on 
        price. The far right image is the responsive basket layout.

        before i had begun with JS once i felt comfortable with the languages. It is simply meant to showcase my HTML/CSS ability as although i may not be a very good
        designer im capable of building complex layouts. I have learned a lot since then and would do this completely differently now 
        but im simply moving on to the next project that will be bigger and better and make me much prouder to include here instead.
