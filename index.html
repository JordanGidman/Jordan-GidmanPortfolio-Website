          <p class="tab-text">
            This entire portfolio is made from scratch by me, and i would consider
            this is a project in itself. I am mostly self-taught over the last 16 months i have been learning to code at every opportunity i can and i feel i have come a long way.<br><br>
            <span><img src="img/html-logo.png" class="skill-logo" alt="html logo"> HTML</HTML></span> - Confident. Although i am very confident with writing semantic HTML i am
            also aware that i do not know everything and i am excited to use it
            more. 
            <br /><br />
            <span><img src="img/css-logo.png" class="skill-logo" alt="css logo"> CSS</span> - Confident. I feel i can make almost anything i see with CSS
            but again i know far from everything and i have yet to dive into any
            CSS Frameworks which i cant wait to do. CSS animation is probably the only area i have not gotten into at this point.<br />
            <br />
            <span><img src="img/javascript-logo.png" class="skill-logo" alt="javascript logo"> JavaScript</span> - Confident. I do know the fundamentals as well as some higher level concepts of javascript as
            you can see both in this portfolio and on my GitHub and i can build
            apps and functionality from the ground up. My JavaScript knowledge improves every day and i do feel that even areas of JS i am still not as confident with i simply need to briefly refamiliarize myself with them to get going.
            <br /><br />
            <span><img src="img/react-logo.png" class="skill-logo" alt="react logo">React</span> - Almost Confident. 
            I have been delving into the React library for some time now and i have gotten to a point now of building 
            solid projects using it and i am increasingly excited to continue expanding my react 
            capabilities. I am however confident using it and i am already quite familiar with and enjoy JSX and the component style of programming react uses.

            Breif summary of my employment history and skills gained from it
          </h4>
          <p class="tab-text">
            For a more detailed and formatted work history please see my CV. To sum things up i have had no relevant work experience
            as of yet other than a single gallery site i created for a freelance client. I have been learning and building front-end projects for around a year and a half now. I have had jobs that given me numerous transferrable skills ranging from working with a sales agency
            which gave a lot of insight and training into marketing, sales and E-Commerce. I have also worked in nightclubs and bars
            which was a high speed, high pressure environment dealing with intoxicated customers and defusing situations in a fast-paced environment. 
            <br> <br>
            My current job with the NHS has helped me refine my problem solving ability as the nature of my work means i solve
            issues that arise during the appointment booking process. And although its nothing compared to using code to solve a
            problem, it does require critical thinking which i find is incredibly useful when coding.

            Some personal details to help you get to know me
          </h4>
          <p class="tab-text">
           My name is Jordan Gidman and im a 25 year old Computing graduate from bolton. About 18 months ago i started my journey of 
            learning to code. Although i graduated from university computing was rather broad with very
             little emphasis on web thus leading me to find the career i wanted but still not in possession of the coding ability necesarry to get it. As soon as i built my first calculator from scratch i was hooked. 
             The endless possibilty and room for
            learning. Its hard to ever get bored of something that is constantly evolving and improving as it grows and expands and that is
            how i found my passion for Web Development. Im highly ambitious and motivated to work in this industry that i have become so passionate about. I have found a career path i can enjoy and i will not stop learning and growing until i get it.
            <br><br>
            I have always loved solving puzzles and problems ever since i was read sherlock holmes as 
            a child and im happy to have found a career in which you get to solve puzzles. 
            Outside of coding i love to play the occasional video 
            games such as Counter Strike, WoW, and Elden Ring, and ive probably seen any TV show 
            you can think of. I also love to travel when and wherever i can and see some of the amazing things our world has to offer.

      <p class="modal-text">This is a fully responsive bug tracker CRUD app. 
        It allows users to create and sign into accounts create and edit bugs 
        and projects to be tracked. The user can join a team and multiple users can work on 
        the same projects and bugs at once. The data is stored to firebase which i have 
        integrated with this app to store accounts and the relevant data for 
        those accounts. The bugs have a status a name a priority all of which 
        can be edited as well. You can click on individual bugs and open a 
        larger information panel which will show the details of the clicked bug.
         i am currently working on having it so that notes can be added to each 
         bug by other users and also for each bug to have a changes array that 
         will track all changes made to a bug and therefor give each bug a 
         history log of each change. However due to this requiring much more 
         storage i will be holding off on this until i have seen usage data for 
         the site.

      <p class="modal-text">This is a fully responsive gallery website that i built freelance 
        for a digital art producer and photographer. To bring this site to life i have used: <br><br> 
        -React <br>
        -JavaScript <br>
        -HTML/CSS <br>
        -Firebase <br>
        -EmailJS <br> <br>
        I learned a lot making this project and to date this is my proudest project. I have used a parallax image effect on the homepage which looks beautiful. And the application works 
        with firebase on the backend for the saving and rendering of the clients images. One of the things i had to keep in mind here is that the client is not tech-savy
        and as such wanted to be able to upload and delete images from the use of the site itself. and so i have added a protected admin panel for the client to use. 
        This is a clone and test version so to access the admin controls you must log in with the email of: "guest@gmail.com" and password: "password" which 
        will allow you to see the admin panel as well as the delete buttons for the images on the gallery and hero page.

        This allows for persistent messaging so if you view your chat with a user, all your previous messages will be there. You can add users to your friends list or simply go from the chats sidebar.
        This project taught me a lot about using firebase. I needed users to be able to create an account and have a profile image so for the first time in this project
         i worked with firebase cloud storage for the storing and retrieving of user profile images allowing each user to have their own image saved via their user id.
          You can send messages or images both will work.

      <h2 class="modal-title highlight">React Car Rental Site</h2>
      <p class="modal-text">This is my first portfolio quality project made using the React 
        library. The idea behind this project 
        was to build a modern design website that you might encounter on the web. I have also 
        simulated recieving and rendering the data about the cars for the vehichle 
        models section from an api by having this data stored in a seperate file and rendering based on this data as i 
        would if i were recieving the data from an api. Meaning to add additional cars to the 
        fleet we simply update the carData file with a new car and react will handle the rest. 
        Building this project has taught me a lot about react from hooks such as useState 
        to manage changing data to using props between components as well as the parent child 
        relationships between components that we can utilise to passdown our setter function to have components that change the state of another. I also found a love for JSX during this project. 
        The ability to write HTML/CSS and JS all in one component is incredibly time saving 
        and concise which i absolutely love. I am excited to press further into my react 
        journey as there are still some hooks and other aspects of react i am not familiar 
        with at this time, however i do feel confident with react already and i feel this 
        project shows that. I am now simply building on foundation.

      <p class="modal-text">How well do you know your movie ratings? The objective of this multiplayer 
        react game is for all the players to choose 3 movies each. The ratings out of 100 for the 3 
        movies are added together and the closest person to the target wins. I made this game using 
        all the react features i have been learning up until this point, from custom hooks to 
        useReducer and useRef as well as the basics like useState and useEffect. This application 
        also uses API integration for both the posters of movies and the ratings of them.

      <h2 class="modal-title highlight">React Speed Typing App</h2>
      <p class="modal-text">This is a React speed typing test application. It is simple in nature
        but i feel uses a good amount of react skills and concepts. This application uses a react
        library to generate random words which the user is tasked with typing as many of as they can. 
        for me the most difficult part of this application was the text effect. Being that i needed a way 
        for the user to give input and to do this i have simply positioned the words, the input and the text
        display which is the text that shows after the user has typed either red or white depending 
        on if the letter is correct or not. For the timer i have utilised a useEffect that calls a
        setInterval and setTimeout to manage the countdown and allow for the words per minute calculations.
        This is V1 as i plan to remake this with some chart libraries for the results and i feel the typing 
        needs to be handled in another way but i am aware i would need the use of custom hooks which 
        i have not yet gotten in to.

      <p class="modal-text">This is a fully responsive E-Commerce basket app that is fully functional. It allows
        the user to add any of the video game keys you see on offer to a cart which tracks the number of
        items that have been added and displays it to screen it will also calculate a total cost for the 
        basket and users can add and remove items and the total will remain up to date. This was my first 
        "real world" application and i learned a lot about the DOM and event bubbling. i have also added
        sorting buttons which can be seen in the second image that are functional and will sort based on 
        price. The far right image is the responsive basket layout.

      <p class="modal-text">This is a responsive single page JavaScript application that is isnpired by the tvshow
        countdown. The user is given a string of random letters and they are tasked with making the longest word they can from 
        those letters in 30 seconds. The app is plugged in to a dictionary API as part of the checks used to ensure the word given 
        by the user is valid. Valid being that the word is a real word and also consists only of letters shown that round. I have also ensured that the highscore 
        is persistent for the user. As i am storing only one variable i have not used a database but instead i am utilizing the browsers localStorage<br><br> I have not 
        included any extra images here because i have actually deployed the site so please use the link below to play the game and see what highscores you can get.

      <p class="modal-text">This project is my second react project that i have built that i consider worthy of inclusion on here.
         I have learned alot since my first car rental site project. Delving further into state management as well as better understanding useEffect and how to implement it.
          I have used derived state for components that all require access to the same parent state to work.
           I have taken full advantage of useEffect to listen for win and lose conditions as well as
            watching for bet wins and losses and updating the application as necessary.

      <p class="modal-text">Quick disclaimer here: This project was made 
        as part of a udemy course so although i did code this it was with the 
        assistance and design material given by the author of the course. 
        This is the only project on this portfolio however that was not built 
        completely independantly from scratch by me.<br><br>This project is an app that 
        allows users to search for recipes by typing any food in. They can also 
        create their own recipes which will only be visible to them. and increase the number of 
        servings and the required ingredients will update as needed Users can 
        also bookmark recipes they like. The app uses an API to GET and 
        POST the recipes for the user. This project follows the MVC architecture
         and was my first real introduction to it. I learned about a lot of 
         important concepts such as the publisher subscriber model for 
         event handling and propegating errors through to a single error handler 
         as well as some experience with modular javascript as a whole which i 
         feel will be very useful for my next step of learning react.
